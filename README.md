As a data scientist at the telecom company "Neo," our task is to analyze customer churn data to develop insightful and effective strategies to retain customers who are switching to competitors. This project involves comprehensive details of data analysis, data processing, data variation, and the application of various machine learning algorithms. By leveraging Python libraries such as scikit-learn, matplotlib, and others, we aim to build robust predictive models to understand and mitigate customer churn.
